    <p>The Research Directorate is situated within the Crops Research Laboratory (CRL) compound along the Batac-Paoay road, about 500 meters southwest of the MMSU FEM-Hall (Administration Building) and about 2.0 km away from the City proper of Batac.  Within the CRL compound are the Office of the Director of Research,  researchers' offices, laboratories and other research support facilities, i.e. One-Stop - Information Shop (training/meeting hall), barn (stock rooms), bamboo craft center, seed bank, bioethanol production area, among others.   The CRL also houses the offices of the Ilocos Agriculture and Aquatic Resources Research and Development Consortium (ILAARRDEC) where MMSU is the base agency, University Center for Gender and Development (UCGAD), Intellectual Property Office (IPO), Tuklas Lunas Development Center, and Higher Education Regional Research Center (HERRC), Center for Climate-Resilient Agriculture (CCRA).</p>
    <p>On-station experiments in the agriculture and allied disciplines are conducted in the research experimental station located in the main campus representing a rainfed lowland environment with a total area of 202 ha. Likewise, field experiments  for legumes are also conducted at the 7.6 ha MMSU Experimental Farm in Dingras campus, Dingras, Ilocos Norte.  On-station experiments in fisheries, on the otherhand, are conducted at the MMSU campus in Currimao, Ilocos Norte while livestock researches are set-up in the 1.6 ha livestock area at Nagbacsan.   Forestry and agroforestry researches are set-up at the Forest Reserve Areas in Lubbot and Payao, City of Batac covering a total of 1068.13 hectares.</p>
    <p>Within the Batac Experimental Area is the Agro-meteorological Station which is jointly managed by the PAGASA-Department of Science and Technology and MMSU.  The station provides weather data to university researchers as well as students and other stakeholders.</p>

       <h5>Tissue Culture Laboratory</h5>
       <img style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 200px; margin-right: 20px;" src="images/tissue_culture.jpg" alt="Tissue Culture Laboratory">
       <p>The priority concern of the tissue culture laboratory of the university is to conduct researches on high-value crops which could be instrumental in uplifting the economic conditions of farmers not only in the Ilocos, but also in nearby provinces.</p>
       <p>It aims to: a) rapidly propagate disease-free planting materials of high-value crops in order to cater to the needs of farmer clientele in the Ilocos Region and b) periodically produce a large number of plants that are genotypically the same as the mother/stock plants.</p>
       <p>The tissue culture laboratory is principally intended for the R&D program on micropropagation technique, mass propagation of disease-free germplasm of high-value crops such as garlic, and for the rapid multiplication of slow-growing crops such as orchids. Further, this is also used for instructional purposes.</p>
       <p>This laboratory is located beside the College of Agriculture, Food and Sustainable Development.</p>
