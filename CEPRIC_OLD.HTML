                    <p>July 22-26, 2024 - CSUCC Energy and Power Research and Innovation Center (CEPRIC) participated in Brigada Eskwela 2024 conducted by the DepEd Schools of Magallanes District from July 22-26, 2024. This initiative aimed to prepare schools for the upcoming academic year by addressing potential electrical hazards and ensuring a safe learning environment for students.
                        Our team provided essential services, including electrical system assessments, electrical wiring installation and repairs, and other electrical-related services. This effort is part of the CSUCC College of Engineering and Information Technology pre-extension program BUSWAK which stands for 𝘉𝘂𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘜𝘱 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘁𝘦𝘮𝘴, 𝘞𝘪𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘈𝘂𝘁𝘰𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘒𝘯𝘰𝘸𝘭𝘦𝘥𝘨𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘋𝘦𝘱𝘌𝘥 𝘔𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘓𝘎𝘜 𝘰𝘧 𝘔𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘦𝘴.
                        The primary goal of this project is to safeguard students from electrical hazards before they return to school, making classrooms a secure and conducive environment for learning.
                        We successfully rendered our services to eight ( 8 ) schools: Magallanes Central Elementary School, Buhang Elementary School, Caloc-an Elementary School, Sto. Niño Elementary School, Dahican Elementary School, Magallanes North Elementary School, Magallanes National High School, and Father Urios Academy of Magallanes Inc. (FUAMI).
                        Our center remains committed to contributing to the improvement of educational facilities and ensuring the safety and well-being of both students and staff.</p>

                    <p>June 7, 2024 - The Mindanao Renewable Energy R&D Center (MREC) gathered representatives from research centers, industry partners, and higher education institutions throughout Caraga to conduct the MREC Caraga Partners' Meeting last June 7, 2024, at the Caraga State University in Butuan City. The meeting was attended by various renewable energy stakeholders in the region, with representatives from Caraga State University and the Mindanao Renewable Energy Acceleration and Coordination Hub (MinREACH). The meeting was also attended by MREC's new partners in the region from various sectors: the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers, Father Saturnino Urios University, Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology, and several new industry partners. 
                        During the meeting, MREC discussed its ongoing projects and presented the opportunities available in the consortium to its partners. This was followed by a thorough discussion of the research challenges and interests in Caraga, where the need for comprehensive renewable energy resource mapping in the region has become apparent. Among the other significant challenges identified during the discussions was the reevaluation of the electrical grid infrastructure and the need to adapt renewable energy applications in isolated communities throughout the region.
                        MREC, a collaborative R&D center on renewable energy, is among the niche R&D centers in the region (NICER) of the Department of Science and Technology, hosted at and chaired by the Ateneo de Davao University through its Center for Renewable Energy and Appropriate Technologies (AdDU-CREATE).</p>

Majority of the full-time researchers specialize in various fields of agriculture such as crop science, soil science, agricultural engineering, crop protection, agricultural education/extension and animal science. The others are specialists in related fields such as forestry, fisheries, biology, communication, economics, environmental science, and education. These researchers are not only involved in the actual conduct of researches but also provide research support services such as statistical analysis, economic analysis, editing technical reports, undergraduate thesis advising, preparation of visual aids including powerpoint presentation and posters and preparation of technoguides, bulletins, brochures and leaflets. In addition to the full-time researchers, faculty from the colleges are also engaged in research activities whose specialization are under various disciplines. </p>
